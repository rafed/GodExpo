# Multilingual website with Hugo

This example was kindly contributed by Egon Elbre in November 2013
as a wonderful proof-of-concept for internationalization (i18n)
and multilingualization (m17n) in Hugo-generated websites.

The example works well for the most part, though some minor issues remain.
