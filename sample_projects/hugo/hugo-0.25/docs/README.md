# Hugo Docs

Documentation site for [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), the very fast and flexible static site generator built with love in GoLang.

## Branches

* The `master` branch is the **current Hugo version** and will be auto-deployed to [gohugo.io/](https://gohugo.io/).
* Anything not relevant to the current Hugo version goes into the `dev` branch.
* Changes in [hugo/docs](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/tree/master/docs) will, in general, be merged once every release, but can be manually merged/cherry picked if needed. This goes both ways.
* All contributions that is not tightly coupled with code changes, should be made directly to `hugoDocs`.
* But we also merge PRs into  [hugo/docs](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/tree/master/docs), but preferably changes that is related to the code in the PR itself

To summarize, we have two branches in this repository: `master` (current Hugo) and `dev` (next Hugo).
