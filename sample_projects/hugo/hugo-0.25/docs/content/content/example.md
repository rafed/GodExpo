Some things are better shown than explained. The following is a very basic example of a content file written in [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/):

**mysite/content/project/nitro.md â†’ http://mysite.com/project/nitro.html**

With TOML front matter:

<pre><code class="language-toml">+++
date        = "2013-06-21T11:27:27-04:00"
title       = "Nitro: A quick and simple profiler for Go"
description = "Nitro is a simple profiler for your Golang applications"
tags        = [ "Development", "Go", "profiling" ]
topics      = [ "Development", "Go" ]
slug        = "nitro"
project_url = "https://github.com/spf13/nitro"

</code><code class="language-markdown"># Nitro
